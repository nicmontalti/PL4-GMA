READ ME:

All measurements were done on channel 0 of the PSAU! Thus, only read off of channel 0 for the threshold voltage in the condition files. 

Do NOT use the data in the 'Extras' file.

The gain for the CsI data was set quite high, so you are looking at the lower end of the spectrum (more towards X-rays). Furthermore,
the spectrum sometimes 'cuts off' at certain peaks. Approximate where the peak would be and try to explain why this happens (think
about the gain, how does it relate to the counts as well?)
